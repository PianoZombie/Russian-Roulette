This game is designed to be played on your terminal. To play it, YOU MUST first download node.js and npm readlineSync.

Node.js is a program that expands javascripts uses to more than just web development. It's mainly used for server-side development.
readlineSync is an npm package that allows you to use the console to make prompts. Similar to the input method on Python.

To run the program you need a set of commands. (The instructions below are for PowerShell, idk how to do it with Unix)
Also, make sure you run PowerShell/Command Prompt with administrator. (again idk the Unix equivalent of this)

1. Open your terminal
2. type 'cd [file path]' into your terminal. cd means "change directory." Btw, if you're copy pasting the file path make sure it doesn't
include the file name. I.e if your file path is C:\Users\russian-roulette.js, then type into your terminal 'cd C:\Users'. If you somehow
are still stuck, then idk what to tell you lol
3. Type into your terminal 'node russian-roulette.js'. "node" is short for Node.js, it'll make sure that the file is ran with Node.js and
therefore it won't fail to work

I am not responsible for whatever damage you do to your machine with this program. So please don't risk System32 being deleted just because
you were being stupid. (Though I'm pretty sure the program can't delete System32 since it doesn't have permissions).
