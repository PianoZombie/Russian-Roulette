This game is designed to be played on your terminal. To play it, **YOU MUST** first install node.js.

Node.js is a program that expands javascripts uses to more than just web development. It's mainly used for server-side development.

To run the program you need a set of commands.
Also, if you run this on Windows make sure to run Powershell/CMD with administrator. The program works on Linux too, but obviously instead of running w/ admin you'd add sudo to the last command.

Open your terminal and then change into the directory your file is in.
```shell
cd C:\whatever\the\path\to\your\file\is
```
Btw, if you're copy pasting the file path make sure it doesn't include the file name. 
I.e if your file path is C:\Users\russian-roulette.js, then you would type into your terminal
```shell
cd C:\Users
```
Run this command
```shell
node russian-roulette.js (or whatever the js file is named)
```

WARNING: ANY FILE(S) DELETED BY THIS PROGRAM ARE GONE PERMANENTLY. YOU CANNOT RECOVER THEM* AND THEY DO NOT GO TO THE RECYCLE BIN.

I am not responsible for whatever damage you do to your machine with this program. So please don't risk System32 being deleted just because 
you were being stupid. (Though I'm pretty sure the program can't delete System32 since the program doesn't have perms lol).

*There is actually a possiblity of recovering your deleted files through the use of certain tools, but without them there's not an explicit way to recover your file(s)
